Dear MeerTime user, 

We are upgrading the user management system for the MeerTime portal. As part of this upgrade, 
the single MeerTime account (meertime) that users have been accessing the system with will be retired on September 14, 2022. 

To use the MeerTime portal thereafter, every user will require their own personal account. We have created a provisional account 
for you using this email address '{{to}}'. You will need to activate it (with the link below) and 
will be asked to set a password at that time. Please click on the following link to activate 
your new account: {{activation_link}}. 

If you believe this email has been incorrectly sent to you, please let us know at hpc-support@swin.edu.au . 

Kind Regards, MeerTime Support Team
